## Databricks vs Snowflake Detailed Comparison

| Feature | Databricks | Snowflake |
|---------|------------|-----------|
| Core Concept | Lakehouse (data lake + warehouse + ML/AI) | Data Cloud / Warehouse (structured + BI focus) |
| Primary Strength | Data engineering, ML/AI, streaming, unstructured/semi-structured data | SQL analytics, BI dashboards, governance, simplicity |
| Data Types Supported | Structured, semi-structured (JSON, Avro, ORC), unstructured (images, video, docs), streaming | Structured + semi-structured (JSON, Avro, XML, Parquet); weak in unstructured + streaming |
| Processing Engine | Apache Spark, Delta Lake, Photon (vectorized engine) | Proprietary MPP (Massively Parallel Processing) |
| ML/AI Support | ✅ Built-in MLflow, AutoML, GenAI support, notebooks, integration with Hugging Face, MosaicML | ⚠️ Limited, ML via integrations (Snowpark ML, external services) |
| Streaming | ✅ Strong: Auto Loader, Structured Streaming, near real-time pipelines | ❌ Weak: Micro-batch only, no true streaming engine |
| Query Language | SQL, Python, R, Scala, Java, notebooks | SQL-first (Snowpark allows Python, Java, Scala) |
| Ease of Use | More complex (engineer-focused) | Very simple (analyst/SQL-focused) |
| Performance | Very fast for ETL, ML, batch & streaming; Photon boosts SQL queries | Very fast for SQL analytics & BI; strong query optimization |
| Governance | Unity Catalog (fine-grained access, lineage, audit, cross-cloud sharing) | Robust RBAC, data sharing via Snowflake Data Marketplace |
| Deployment / Cloud | Multi-cloud (AWS, Azure, GCP) | Multi-cloud (AWS, Azure, GCP) |

## Key Takeaways

- **Snowflake**: Analytics powerhouse - simple, SQL-first, great for BI dashboards
- **Databricks**: Engineering + AI powerhouse - handles all data types (batch, streaming, ML, AI)

### Industry Reality
Many companies use both platforms together:
- Databricks for data ingestion, transformation, ML/AI, streaming
- Snowflake for serving SQL analytics, BI dashboards, business users
